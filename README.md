# Made with &hearts; using <a href="https://huggingface.co/knkarthick">Transformers </a>

<h3> Run the application on your local machine: </h3>

```
git clone https://github.com/ayanatherate/Lyricsummarizer.git 
cd Lyricsummarizer
pip install -r requirements.txt 
streamlit run app.py 
```

<h3>Improvements needed: </h3>
1) As expected, the huge size of the Transformers model makes it difficult to deploy it anywhere.
2) Addition of song-lyrics emotion analysis feature.
